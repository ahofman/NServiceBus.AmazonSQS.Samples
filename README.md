# NServiceBus.SQS.Samples
The classic NServiceBus Video Store sample implemented with Amazon SQS.

To get up and running, first you must set up some AWS access keys as described [here](https://github.com/ahofman/NServiceBus.SQS). 

Then, simply clone or download this repository, open the solution, build and run. 
This sample uses the Sydney AWS region (ap-southeast-2) - this can be configured in the app.config and web.config files in the sample.
